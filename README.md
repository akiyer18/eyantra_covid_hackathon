This web application utilizes a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict the likelihood of a patient having COVID-19 based on several health parameters. If the prediction indicates a moderate to high chance, the application provides a Google Meet link for the patient to connect with a doctor for an online consultation.
